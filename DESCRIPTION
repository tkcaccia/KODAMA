Title: Knowledge Discovery by Accuracy Maximization
Description: A self-guided, weakly supervised learning algorithm for feature extraction from noisy and 
  high-dimensional data. It facilitates the identification of patterns that reflect underlying group 
  structures across all samples in a dataset. The method incorporates a novel strategy to integrate 
  spatial information, improving the interpretability of results in spatially resolved data.
