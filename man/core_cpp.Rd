\title{Maximization of Cross-Validateed Accuracy Methods}

\description{This function performs the maximization of cross-validated accuracy by an iterative process}

\usage{
core_cpp(x,
         xTdata = NULL, 
         clbest, 
         Tcycle = 20, 
         FUN = c("fastpls","simpls"), 
         f.par.pls = 5, 
         constrain = NULL, 
         fix = NULL) 
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{a matrix.}
  \item{xTdata}{a matrix for projections. This matrix contains samples that are not used for the maximization of the cross-validated accuracy. Their classification is obtained by predicting samples on the basis of the final classification vector.}
  \item{clbest}{a vector to optimize.}
  \item{Tcycle}{number of iterative cycles that leads to the maximization of cross-validated accuracy.}
  \item{FUN}{classifier to be consider. Choices are "\code{fastpls}" and "\code{simpls}".}
  \item{f.par.pls}{parameters of the classifier. If the classifier is \code{KNN}, \code{fpar} represents the number of neighbours. If the classifier is \code{PLS-DA}, \code{fpar} represents the number of components.}
  \item{constrain}{
  	a vector of \code{nrow(data)} elements. Supervised constraints can be imposed by linking some samples in such a way that if one of them is changed, all other linked samples change in the same way (\emph{i.e.}, they are forced to belong to the same class) during the maximization of the cross-validation accuracy procedure. Samples with the same identifying constrain will be forced to stay together.
  	}
  \item{fix}{
  	a vector of \code{nrow(data)} elements. The values of this vector must  be \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. By default all elements are \code{FALSE}. Samples with the \code{TRUE} fix value will not change the class label defined in \code{W} during the maximization of the cross-validation accuracy procedure. For more information refer to Cacciatore, \emph{et al.} (2014).
  	}
}

\value{
    The function returns a list with 3 items:
    \item{clbest}{a classification vector with a maximized cross-validated accuracy.}
    \item{accbest}{the maximum cross-validated accuracy achieved.}
    \item{vect_acc}{a vector of all cross-validated accuracies obtained.}
    \item{vect_proj}{a prediction of samples in \code{xTdata} matrix using the vector clbest. This output is present only if \code{xTdata} is not \code{NULL}.}
